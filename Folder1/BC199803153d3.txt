RESUME OF CASE:

On 1 Dec 99, the Board considered and denied the applicant’s original request to set aside his Article 15, dated 22 Aug 96; Article 15, dated 6 Sep 96; and 
vacation of suspended nonjudicial punishment (NJP), dated 4 Nov 96.  In the initial case, he contended that all three actions were initiated by the same 
commander who failed to follow the advice of the legal office on these matters and refused to consider clear and convincing evidence that he was the victim 
of domestic violence, not the perpetrator of it.  Furthermore, the vacation of the suspended NJP was based on an incident which should not have been held 
against him; it took place when he was in an extreme emotional state when he was at the mental ward of the hospital in the aftermath of his suicide attempt. 
His commander also failed to consider his excellent duty performance when he made these decisions.  For an accounting of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the applicant’s original request and the rationale of the earlier decision by the Board, see the Record of Proceedings (ROP) at Exhibit F.

On 11 May 10, the applicant submitted new DD Form 149, and a 
subsequent Statement of Counsel, with attachments.  Counsel 
requested reconsideration based upon additional documentation 
the applicant has obtained since the Board’s initial decision.  
Counsel contended the original AFBCMR panel did not enjoy a 
fully developed argument and evidence showing the applicant was 
actually innocent of the charge of domestic violence.  However, 
on 27 Apr 11, the Board considered and denied the applicant’s 
request.  While he had provided a voluminous submission 
describing the volatility of his relationship with his former 
spouse, a substantial portion of his submission was comprised of 
evidence that was a matter of record and considered by the 
commander during the NJP proceedings.  The remainder of his 
submission was comprised of medical documentation, a supporting 
statement from his current spouse, and copies of various studies 
regarding the effects of domestic abuse.  However, the Board 
found the evidence insufficient to conclude the applicant did 
not commit the acts which formed the basis of the NJP actions, 
or that his commander abused his discretionary authority or 
failed to act in good faith when considering the evidence before 
him in arriving at an appropriate punishment for the applicant’s 
misconduct.  For an accounting of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding the applicant’s request for reconsideration and the 
rationale of the earlier decision by the Board, see the Addendum 
to the Record of Proceedings (ROP) at Exhibit I.

In his latest submission, dated 6 Sep 11, Counsel requests 
reconsideration and contends the Board did not consider several 
of its previous decisions, which were cited in the initial 
request for reconsideration, where relief was granted in 
comparable circumstances.  The Court would likely find the Board 
failed to do this and remand the matter to the AFBCMR for 
further consideration.  In support of the applicant’s request 
for reconsideration, Counsel provides a copy of a court decision 
addressing the matter of precedent in an Army Board for 
Correction of Military Records case.

A complete copy of Counsel’s latest submission, with attachment, 
is at Exhibit J.

________________________________________________________________

THE BOARD CONCLUDES THAT:

1.  After again reviewing this application and the evidence 
provided in support of this appeal, the majority of the Board 
remains unconvinced the applicant has been a victim of an error 
or an injustice.  This Board has twice determined the NJP 
actions rendered upon the applicant for assaulting his former 
spouse and subsequently violating a no contact order were 
appropriate to the circumstances and within the commander’s 
discretionary authority.  In his most recent submission, the 
applicant’s counsel argues the Board did not consider certain 
cases previously decided by this Board in evaluating the 
applicant’s requests, essentially asserting that similar 
consideration should be applied to the applicant’s case and the 
requested relief should be granted.  The majority of the Board 
disagrees.  In this respect, the majority notes that each case 
before this Board is considered on its own merits, and precedent 
does not bind us.  While we do strive for consistency in the 
manner in which evidence is evaluated and analyzed, we are not 
bound to recommend relief in one circumstance simply because the 
situation being reviewed appears similar to another case.  In 
the various cases cited by Counsel, the Board granted relief for 
the following reasons:  1) the evidence was insufficient to 
support the charge, 2) there was a failure to properly 
investigate the applicant’s claims, 3) there was no legal basis 
for the action, 4) the commander abused his/her discretionary 
authority, and 5) guilt was questionable and doubt was resolved 
in the applicant’s favor.  However, we have thoroughly reviewed 
the cases cited by the applicant’s counsel and the majority 
finds the circumstances are not applicable in the instant case.  
While the Board determined there was an insufficient basis in 
two of the cited cases to support the commander’s determination 
the applicant committed the alleged misconduct, the majority 
does not find Counsel’s arguments or the documentation provided 
sufficient to conclude the bases of the contested NJP actions in 
the instant case were insufficient.  Counsel contends the 
statement by the purported victim, in and of itself, should not 
have been sufficient to form the basis for the commander’s 
determination the applicant committed the alleged assault, 
particularly in the face of evidence that served to undermine 
her credibility; however, the majority of this Board is not 
convinced the commander relied only upon the victim’s statement 
in determining the applicant had indeed struck his spouse.  In 
this respect, the majority notes the evidence of record contains 
a statement by the commander which indicates that he reviewed 
the applicant’s presentation several times, repeatedly read the 
presentations made by witnesses on his behalf, and, after also 
considering input from the Medical Group/Mental Health unit, 
determined the applicant had indeed struck his wife.  As for the 
case cited by Counsel where the Board granted relief because 
there was a failure to properly investigate the applicant’s 
claims, the majority finds no such showing in this case.  In 
this respect, we again note the evidence of record is 
substantial and the majority is not convinced the commander did 
not give due consideration to the evidence provided by the 
applicant in support of his claims that he did not commit the 
alleged assault.  While Counsel argues the commander’s 
determination had to be incorrect in the face of substantial 
evidence supporting the notion the applicant was subjected to 
physical abuse at the hands of his wife, the majority does not 
believe that said evidence is proof the applicant did not strike 
his wife, nor are we convinced the commander did not exercise 
due diligence in investigating the facts and circumstances of 
the instant case.  In another case cited by Counsel, the Board 
granted relief when it determined the basis of the contested 
action was not legally sufficient; however, we note the NJP 
actions in the instant case were subjected to legal review 
during the matter under review and found to be legally 
sufficient.  As for the case cited by Counsel where the Board 
granted relief when it determined the imposing commander had 
abused his discretionary authority, we find no such showing in 
this case.  In this respect, we note the comments by AFLSA/JAJM 
and agree with their determination the commander acted within 
his discretionary authority in each of the three NJP actions.  
Finally, Counsel cites a case where the Board found the 
applicant’s guilt questionable and resolved doubt in the applicant’s favor.  However, in the cited case, the applicant brought forth substantial evidence that he was indeed not guilty 
of the alleged offense.  However, we have no such showing in 
this case.  Counsel’s primary argument seems to be that because 
there is evidence the applicant was subjected to abuse at the hands of his wife that he must be innocent of the alleged 
offense of striking her and, as such, the initial and subsequent NJP actions should not have been rendered.  The majority of the 
Board disagrees and does not find this a persuasive argument the applicant has been treated unfairly or is the victim of an 
injustice.  In fact, the majority finds it very likely the commander gave careful consideration to this unfortunate 
situation and the applicant’s record of performance as evidenced by his decision to suspend the portion of the punishment that called for the applicant’s 
reduction in grade from staff sergeant (E-5) to senior airman (E-4) and then refrained from vacating said suspension even though the applicant subsequently 
violated a no contact order.  It was not until the applicant committed another act of misconduct the commander finally decided it was appropriate to vacate 
the suspended demotion.  Therefore, in the absence of evidence the applicant was denied rights to which he was entitled, the commander abused his 
discretionary authority, or the punishment rendered was unduly harsh, the majority finds no basis to recommend granting the requested relief.

2.  The applicant's case is adequately documented and it has not been shown that a personal appearance with or without counsel will materially add to our 
understanding of the issues involved.  Therefore, the request for a hearing is not favorably considered.
